## What I learned 

- The Linux OS is mainly operated through the terminal using typed commands
- I learned how to create a new folder using the command: `mkdir [foldername]`
- I learned how to move into a directory using: `cd [foldername]
- Typing `cd` by itself returns you to your home directory
- `mkdir` stands for *make directory* and `cd` stands for *change directory*
- This helped me understand basic navigation and file organization in a Linux environment
- I learned that `touch` : lets you create a file --> `touch [filename]`
