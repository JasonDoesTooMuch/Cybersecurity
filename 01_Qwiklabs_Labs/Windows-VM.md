## What i learned 

- I learned that a virtual machine runs slower than a physical (independent) machine, which helped me understand how an operating system runs when it does not have direct access to hardware
- I explored the Control Panel, which allows you to configure system settings such as network connections, date and time, user accounts, and device settings
- I used Task Manager to view running application and see how much CPUand memroy each process is using
- I also learned about Server Manager, which displays information about storage volumes nad system roles
- I also learned about Server Manager, which displays information about storage volumes and system roles
- Finally i noticed that the "Windows Administrative Tools" section provides shortcuts to advanced system managment applications
